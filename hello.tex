\vspace{25pt}

{\Large\bfseries Creating a Full Stack Web Project using the MERN Stack \\}

{\large In this project, I used React, MongoDB, express, and node.js to create an Real time Editing project. This summary encapsulates the essence of my journey in designing and implementing a full-stack solution.}

\vspace{10pt}

{\large  To create a real-time, multi-user document editing through a seamless
interface. Using React, I created a user-friendly front-end that enabled effortless
interactions and dynamic updates. The back-end, powered by Express.js and Node.js,
seamless real-time communication, ensuring simultaneous edits were synchronized across
users using web sockets. Used MongoDB as database to store data.
